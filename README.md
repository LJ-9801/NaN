# NaN
## Discription
This is a linear algebra library like Numpy, with less utilities kernels such as
a lot of the array manipulation functionalities. The goal of this libarary is to 
run matrix calculation on both CPU and GPU, so more functions will be implemented
in the near future. Rigth now the following kernels are available.
### matrix generation kernels
1. eye
2. zeros
3. randn(normal distribution)
4. rand(uniform distribution)
5. rot2
6. rot3

### matrix math kernels
1. add/substract
2. matmul

## Requirements
1. have python the pip install

## Installation
1. run "pip install ." to install the library

## TODO
1. dynamic typing
2. transpose
2. GPU support

## Kernels To Be Implemented
1. matrix factorization
2. solvers
3. outter/inner/dot/kron product
