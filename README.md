# NaN
## Discription
This is a linear algebra library like Numpy, with less utilities kernels such as
a lot of the array manipulation functionalities. The goal of this libarary is to 
run matrix calculation on both CPU and GPU, so more functions will be implemented
in the near future. Rigth now the following kernels are available.
### matrix generation kernels
1. eye
2. zeros
3. randn
4. rot2
5. rot3

### matrix math kernels
1. add/substract
2. matmul

### matrix factorization(TO BE IMPLEMENTED)

## Requirements(For Now)
1. Install and activate a conda environment with a prefered Python version
2. That's it!


## TODO
1. matrix indexing is curretly not avaliable
2. matrix factorization to be implemented
3. dynamic typing
4. GPU support
