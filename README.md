# NaN
## Discription
This is a linear algebra library like Numpy, with less utilities kernels such as
a lot of the array manipulation functionalities. The goal of this libarary is to 
run matrix calculation on both CPU and GPU, so more functions will be implemented
in the near future. Rigth now the following kernels are available.
### matrix generation kernels
1. eye
2. zeros
3. randn
4. rot2
5. rot3

### matrix math kernels
1. add/substract
2. matmul

## Requirements(For Now)
1. Right now it only support Unix-like OS
2. Install and activate a conda environment with a prefered Python version
3. That's it!

## Installation
1. run "python requirement.py" to install the library

## TODO
1. matrix indexing is curretly not avaliable
3. dynamic typing
4. GPU support

## Kernels To Be Implemented
1. matrix factorization
2. solvers
3. outter/inner/dot/kron product
